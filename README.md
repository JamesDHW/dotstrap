# `dotstrap`

> Bootstrap your Mac config with one command. 
>
> A tiny installer that consumes any dotfiles repo that follows the `dotstrap` spec.

## Motivation

Setting up a new Mac often means moving dotfiles, Brewfiles, shell config, and system tweaks by hand. On a new or client machine, you need your tools fast to hit the ground running. Config tends to scatter for different; you should always know what lives where and why it was installed.

`dotstrap` aims to be:
- **fast**: bootstrap your tools and config, as you like them, with one command which is available on a fresh Mac
- **modular**: *all* config lives in `~/.config/<module>`; easy to find and track; simply `rm -rf` to remove
- **low-maintenance**: store config updates in a git repo and simply push to keep up-to-date for later
- **composable**: pull tools and config from multiple git repos to compose mutliple dotstrap profiles

## Quick start

```sh
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesDHW/dotstrap/main/bootstrap.sh)" -- \
  --repo https://github.com/<owner>/<your-config-repo>.git
```

## What `dotstrap` does

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already installed.
- Ensure a `~/.config/` directory exists.
- Generate a base `~/.zshenv` (if absent) that redirects zsh config to `~/.config/zsh`.
- Generate base config modules for:
    - `zsh`: provides an entry-point `.zshrc` that sources all `~/.config/*/.zshrc` fragments,
      and leaves a stub `~/.zshrc` in $HOME for compatibility.
    - `homebrew`: manages package installs via homebrew-file, aggregating all module Brewfiles.
- Clone the target repo into `~/.config/`, creating one folder per module.
    - Existing modules are never overwritten; in case of clashes, the user’s modules win.
    - New modules from the repo are added automatically.
- Update the root `~/.config/Brewfile` to include `file` references to each module Brewfile.
- Run `brew install` to install any new packages required by those modules.

On repeat runs:
- Existing modules are left untouched.
- Any new modules from the repo are added.
- The root Brewfile is refreshed to include missing module references, ensuring new packages are installed without duplicating existing ones.

Coming soon:
- Run each `postinstall.d` script once (idempotent)

## The `dotstrap` spec

A compliant config repo:

- Can be cloned with Git (public is simplest, but don't publish any secrets!)
- Organizes config as modules under `~/.config/<module>/`
- Contain a `Brewfile` at the root (generated by `homebrew-file`)

Each module may include:

- `.zshrc` — a shell fragment to be sourced
- (coming soon) `postinstall.d/` — optional scripts (*.sh, *.applescript) run once after install

Example:

```
~/.config/
    git/
        .zshrc
    nvim/
        .zshrc
        init.lua
    Brewfile
```

## How it works

`dotstrap` creates a `~/.zshenv` which contains the following:

```sh
# XDG: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}"
export XDG_DATA_HOME="${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"

# This is where zsh will put its config files
export ZDOTDIR="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh"
```

This means that when you open a new `zsh`, the `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc` will run:

```sh
# ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc
# Load per-tool snippets: any ~/.config/*/.zshrc except this one
# Note: snippets are loaded in alphabetical order, configuration in ~/.config/bat/.zshrc will override ~/.config/aws/.zshrc
for f in "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/*/.zshrc(N); do
  [[ "$f" == "$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc" ]] && continue
  source "$f"
done

# Load .zshrc in home directory in case there's extra config there
source "$HOME/.zshrc"

alias zshrc="vim ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc"
```

This loads the `.zshrc` fragments in each config module, such as the core module, homebrew, which sets up `brew` and `brew-file`, which creates and stores a lockfile of all your system dependencies:

```sh
# ~/.config/homebrew/.zshrc
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

export HOMEBREW_BREWFILE="$HOME/.config/Brewfile"

[ -f "$(brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap" ] && source "$(brew --prefix)/etc/brew-wrap"
```

> `dotstrap` only installs config; you own the actual files. Only run on repos you trust!
